# Problem solving
Mastering skills of problem solving in C++ <br>
Based on "Think Like a Programmer" by V. Anton Spraul <br>
<pre>
1. Use what you already know.
2. Then use one or more of the following to discover new ways/tools: libraries, patterns, algorithms, APIs.<br>
3. Write simple procedures to separate each action in a simple "list" down the editor's window. Editing functions at this stage is a lot easier.
4. When everything is set to be working properly, convert the code into OOP.

P.S. Don't forget about spacial and base cases.

This is all pretty much about constructing algorithms and using the code wrriten before. Creativity is all-important here, the efficiency is secondary, though I am trying to make it the most efficient I can, having skills as they are.
