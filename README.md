# Problem solving
Mastering skills of problem solving in C++ <br>
Based on "Think Like a Programmer" by V. Anton Spraul <br>
<pre>
1. Use what you already know.
2. Then use one or more of the following to discover new ways/tools: 
   libraries, patterns, algorithms, APIs.
3. Write simple procedures to separate each action in a simple "list"
   down the editor's window. Editing functions at this stage is a lot easier.
4. When everything is set to be working properly, convert the code into OOP.

P.S. Don't forget about spacial and base cases.

Notes:
0. DON'T GET FRUSTRATED! <br>
1. Recursion: don't think about it too complex at the time you've started.<br>
Take the beginning and the first step, abstract all other steps.<br>
2. Memory and speed efficiencies are 2 differenct things and usually they don't correlate.<br>
3. Reuse basic code you saved. Better keep it basic for the reuse and grow it as you go along a new problem.<br>
